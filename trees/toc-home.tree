\title{18.404 notes}
\author{Jason Chen}

\p{These are my notes for Theory of Computation (18.404) at MIT during Fall 2019. I cannot guarantee the accuracy of these notes, because they were quickly typed up (mostly) during the lecture with minimal proofreading. I take responsibility for all errors found in the document. Pull requests for typos/mistakes welcome!}
